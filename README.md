## My Megaverse Creation Adventure 🚀
I'm thrilled to share my solution to the Crossmint Megaverse Coding Challenge! With the help of the Megaverse Creator API, I've conjured up a brand new megaverse, complete with 🪐POLYanets, 🌙SOLoons, and ☄comETHs swirling about in cosmic chaos. 

Big shoutout to Crossmint Team for creating these cool NFT APIs! 😄

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Poetry

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crossmint-megaverse.git

2. Make sure Poetry is installed on your system. If not, run:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. install the project dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   poetry install

5. You can now run the project using the command: `poetry run <command>`. Replace `<command>` with the command to execute this project.

   Note: Make sure to activate the project's virtual environment before running any Poetry commands. You can do this by running: `poetry shell`.

6. Run the solution I created by using this command:
   ```bash
   poetry run python crossmint_megaverse/MegaverseBuilder.py

7. Run the unit tests I created by running this command:
   ```bash
   poetry run coverage run -m pytest

## Crafting the Megaverse 🎨
My journey began with the simple task of sculpting a megaverse with specific parameters and shapes. Armed with the Megaverse Creator API, I arranged my celestial objects like pieces of a cosmic puzzle. Each 🪐POLYanet, 🌙SOLoon, and ☄comETH was placed with care, resulting in a cosmos unlike any other.

## Mastering the API 💻
In the initial phase of the challenge, I dove headfirst into the Megaverse Creator API. Through trial and error (and a healthy dose of determination), I mastered the art of interaction. Creating 🪐POLYanets and validating their existence became second nature, setting the stage for the grand creation to come.

## Shaping the Cosmic Landscape 🌌
Armed with newfound expertise, I embarked on the creation of my megaverse. With each line of code, I sculpted a vast expanse of cosmic wonder. 🪐POLYanets danced with 🌙SOLoons, while ☄comETHs added a touch of whimsy to the mix.

## A Journey to Remember 🚀
My solution to the Crossmint Megaverse Coding Challenge is more than just lines of code—it's a testament to my determination and ingenuity. Look forward to the next challenge!!
